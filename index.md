## Course Description

[Syllabus](Math105_W18_Syllabus.pdf)

This course presents the concepts of precalculus from four points of view: geometric (graphs), numeric (tables), symbolic (formulas), and written (verbal descriptions). The emphasis is on the mathematical modeling of real-life problems using linear, polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions. Students develop their reading, writing, and questioning skills in an interactive classroom setting.

## Textbook 

**Functions Modeling Change: A Preparation for Calculus**  Connally, Hughes-Hallett, Gleason, et. al. 5th Edition (New edition).


The textbook is used everyday in class for group work assignments. Please bring your textbooks to class everyday.
